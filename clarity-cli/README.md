# Clarity CLI

Before doing anything, you need to download clarity cli from the development branch artifacts and add it here.

E.g. download the latest artifacts for stacks-blockchain (e.g. https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/actions/runs/944388105#artifacts) unpack and copy `clarity-cli.exe` to this folder.
